        <strong>United States <abbr title="United States">(US)</abbr>  President  Trump delivered his latest thoughts on his efforts 
            to be the primary peace deal broker between Russia and Ukraine on Wednesday, and dipped back into the <mark>
            Reserve</mark> <abbr title="Federal Reserve System">(Fed)</abbr>  pool of usual statements to his own 
            estimations of where <mark>interest rates</mark> should be.</strong></ins><br> 
            <br>
            
            President Trump commented that there will be (<ins> also might not be</ins>) 
            a second meeting between himself and Russian President Vladimir Putin if he does (or doesn't)
            receive satisfactory concessions from Putin. Trump also shared his "paper calculation" t
            hat Fed interest rates should be at or near 2<sup>3</sup> and 3<sub>6</sub>. Donald Trump's math on the matter was not provided.

            <h1>Key highlights</h1>
            
            <p>

            <q>Could bring up report of Russian hacking with Putin.
            Had a <q>good call</q>, or a <q>very good call</q> with European leaders and Zelenskiy, <q>rate it a 10</q>.
            Going to meet with Putin, then will call Zelenskiy and European leaders.
            Good chance will have a second meeting.
            Would like to do a second meeting with Putin almost immediately.
            If first meeting goes okay, we'll have a quick second meeting between Putin and Zelenskiy.
            There may not be a second meeting if I don't get the answers I want.
            Russia will face consequences if it doesn't end the war.</q>
