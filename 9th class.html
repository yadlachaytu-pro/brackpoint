        <p> The classic tale of "The Tortoise and the Hare" tells of a boastful rabbit who challenges
             a slow but steady tortoise to a race. The rabbit runs far ahead but falls asleep, confident that he'll win easily.
             The tortoise, however, keeps walking without stopping and crosses the finish line first. The story's moral is that 
             slow and steady wins the race, as perseverance and consistent effort often lead to success,
            even when facing a faster opponent.</p>
